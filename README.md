# Plotly-series

Plotly is an incredibly powerful library with Python for data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence related operations. You are able to use Plotly online, offline, and in Jupyter Notebooks that allow us to build extremely powerful and interactive visualizations with our data. Join us in this series with Plotly and we are going to work from the ground up installing Plotly and then exploring the library while building further visualizations to get some hands on experience!
